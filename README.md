## 1. UX <a name="UX"></a>

The primary target audience are collaborators/employers in the game industry who wish to see my knowledge in Javascript/jQuery.


#### I. User Stories: <a name="UX2"></a>

1. As an employer who recieved a link to Johans website, I want to see the game and test it to judge his skills, so that I can assess if he's eligible for a position.

2. As an assessor I will judge the website on the totality of looks, documentation, testing, and functions among other things. I will take a particular look at the Javascript portion of the page, so that I can assess his score.

3. As a collaborator I want to see if Johan can be of use in a project, so I want to test Johans game. Additionally I want to scroll through the game.js to eye through the written functions for the game and see Johans familiarity with the language.



#### II. Wireframes: <a name="UX3"></a>

* [Wireframes.pdf](assets/wireframes/wireframe.pdf)


1. I changed the direction of the game to scroll horizontal instead of vertical since I wanted to stand out from other examples I found on the internet.

2. The spaceship can now move in 4 directions, up, right, down and left. Even though only sideways movement is vital to the game, I thought it could enhance the game experience to move up closer to the aliens.
The key to this knowledge was to learn that every button has its own keyCode and so I looked up needed keys by console.log(e.keyCode), and lastly how to put them to use.

3. At first I thought I could just move the objects via a for loop, but I had to include a function to push every object onto the HTML via template literals, then another function adds looped movement

4. The alien movement matches the wireframes overall, and moves sideways until it bounces into walls and steps closer to the player and changes sideway direction to fly towards the other side

5. The overlay(startmenu) matches the wireframe kind of as well, but I added the game title as a larger h1 above the Start Game button instead of the title inside the button, to make better use of empty estate



#### III. Development Process: <a name="UX4"></a>

* I struggled initially to understand how to begin writing Javascript on my own. So I began researching until I settled for a simpler type of space shooter game. I watched many videos and tried followed along as they coded nonsense before my tiring eyes, and it didn't make much sense at all.
* However small increments of experience came ticking in as I tried modifying the code myself, and then some tides of progress blossomed and instilled a great feeling of pride, and so I was on my way to my own project.

* Finding a control scheme gave a nice inspiration boost, adding new triggers became easy, however to make functional loops for pushed HTML was harder.

* Every object in my project uses at least 2 functions, a template literal push and a movement increment. Movement increment was easy, however the pushing was difficult because of unfamiliarity with template literals.

* The moveAliens function took some time to learn how to move the whole array with a for loop, and not just single aliens. An if switch statement was later added to change directions as they touch the game boundaries.

* I use only for loops and if conditions in this project, as well as one switch. For loops are needed to iterate through arrays, and if conditions are essential for every condition in the game.
* I didn't use other loops because I don't understand when the other loops when and while are superior yet.

* I learned alot during the development of this project, I had to read up on W3C articles everyday and I saw many youtube tutorials on similar projects, it has been a learning experience.

* collisionDetection is my most worked on function, and it detects rockets against aliens, and lasers against aliens, then splices the array-objects and calls the checkGameover() function.
* For a while earlier in my development everything was offset by a few pixels so I had to test my way to find arbitrary numbers to match the alien hitboxes, this took me more time than I want to admit..
* however the offset bug was later randomly fixed as I fiddled in other functions and now it just includes the + 30 to detect the hitbox of the alien size.

* Near the end of the project I removed unused constants like the gamescreen width and heights, and instead used fixed numbers where needed for spaceship move limits and alien move limits,

* I had a plan to implement spliced explosions in place for the aliens, with a short css animation to remove the explosion after 1s as well, but after some stonewalling and lost development time I dropped it out of scope for this project.


## 2. Features <a name="Features"></a>

* The game is a Space Invaders type of game with moving pictures and a slow scrolling background, 
* The player must destroy 8 Aliens with his spaceship equipped with 2 types of weaponry while avoiding Alien energybombs,
* And he must do so before the aliens reach the left side of the screen.

* The spaceship is controllable with arrows Up, Right, Down and Left, as well as Space for a rocket weapon and Ctrl for a laser cannon.

* The two weapons have different properties, the rocket image has slightly wider and higher css rules and so has a higher chance to trigger the collisionDetection function,
* and to imitate splash damage the rocket splices 2 alien out of the aliens array-object, however the laser cannon particles travel faster across the screen and is easier to hit the aliens with.

* Start game menu shows the game title and a start game button, the start game button is animated via css and uses an .on("click") event to initialize the game via jQuery

* As all aliens are destroyed, an alert is made to notify the player of the Win Game, and a location.reload() repopulates the game with aliens



## 3. Features for the future <a name="Features2"></a>

* Score

* More Levels - need to familiarize myself with constructor functions (I think), to repopulate game with more aliens in other way than location.reload

* Less linear alien movement

* Exploding aliens, I should be able to splice them in the collisionDetection function, however I might not fully grasp variables and function closures yet

* collisionDetection for alien energybombs vs the player

* During my research I came upon other examples of similar games, and specifically another control scheme where something like .keydown(true) and .keydown(false) for each keyCode is used to determine when to move and not move the spaceship,
* I believe this is why these games have a superior sense of control of the playerobject, however it was deemed to complicated for me to include before submit date.

* Better winGame content, perhaps a new weapon for the next level, and a nicely styled HTML overlay rewarding the player who reached the winGame condition

## 5. Testing <a name="Testing"></a>

#### I. Testing Functionality <a name="Testing2"></a>

1. I have done manual testing throughout the development process plus a Jasmine test suite.
2. As the game was finished I have continued to do some manual testing by playing around with it, I added limits to the spaceship movement late so that you don't move outside the gamescreen
2. I have added a Jasmine test suite near the end of my development process to do (18) checks against my functions, objects, and types.
3. I have run the HTML code through [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org) to check for errors in the code, none observed.
4. I have run the CSS code through the [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) to check for errors in the code, none observed.
5. I formatted the HTML code through the use of [Free Formatter](www.freeformatter.com/html-formatter.html)
6. I added vendor prefixes to my css through the help of [Autoprefixer](https://autoprefixer.github.io/)


#### II. User stories testing <a name="Testing3"></a>

1. As an employer I go to see Johans game determined to see his skills, if he's really as good as he postulated in his CV.

    * I click the button to start the game, and try to shoot all the aliens.

2. As a collaborator I check out Johans game to evaluate his skills, to measure his eligibility for inclusion in my development team.

    * Click button to start the game, I will also go to google developer mode to check the console, and the source of the material.

3. As an assessor I go to Johans website determined to check every nook and cranny among which..

    * Play the game and shoot all the aliens.
    * Go through the javascript document to see if Johan follows coding conventions and proper semantics.
    * Make note of everything within the game.
    * Read through the extensive documentation.


#### III. Bugs found <a name="Testing4"></a>

1. As my rocket splices 2 aliens at the same time, a console error sometimes occurs "Cant read property of undefined aliens.top, on line 219 in game.js" which is in the Laser portion of the collisionDetection function, 
I think its a case of race condition where the laser for loop is trying to read the aliens.top property while it is being removed by the concurrent rocket for loop at the same time.
The error seems minor though, as the game continues without fault and both lasers and rockets can continue to splice the aliens for the remainder of the game

2. Alien energybombs don't have collisionDetection yet so will just fly through the player spaceship

3. I had an earlier bug with collisionDetection when the parameter + 30 had to be changed to - 70 and the next line -40 to yield an approximate hitbox,
I never sourced the cause of the bug but later tidying up of the other functions made my collisionDetection normal again, and so I just had to revert to + 30 again.

## 7. Credits <a name="Credits"></a>


* My main attribution should go to 2 guys at Coding Dojo with one video on youtube where they wrote easily digestible code for a game while discussing what was going on [Coding Dojo - Space Invaders](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmqAPQsc1n4&t=1745s).
* After watching this video I understood how to push HTML via template literals and its basically when my project started to come alive.

* My Start Game button should be attributed to one youtube video where I searched for css neon button, [Udemy Course - Neon Button](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex7jGbyFgpA)

* I followed along videos in writing some other short games as well, another space invaders game where I understood nothing, an asteroids game with some concepts better explained, and a paddlegame which really explained canvas properties well, but these were using HTML canvas with code that looked strange for someone unfamiliar to javascript,
* however at this late stage in my development I understand more of the canvas properties and I realize it might be more suited for a moving parts game, as well as being an API for one of the project requirements.

* Credits should also be given to youtuber Ania Kubow who in some tutorials explained several concepts unknown to me, that were useful in my project, like .splice and my $(document).keydown(function(e) control function

* I used jQuery as much as I could, it has very handy shortcuts, specifically event handlers and easy DOM targetting, but sometimes I don't know if there's any equivalent to regular javascript

* Some of the pictures used were taken from flaticon.com, namely the #spaceship and .alien.

* The energy, laser and rocket pictures were found in various picture archives via Google Search

* Scrolling background image was taken from NASAs website, but converted to a minimum size better suited to my website project
